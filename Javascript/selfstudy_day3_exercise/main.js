8. Create a variable to keep track of many rounds have been played in order to win the jackpot
9. If each round costs 50 cents, run the above program 5 times, either manually or use a while loop to help you, in order to learn the average amount of money you have to spend on winning a jackpot ðŸ˜„ 
10. Increase the random number range to be any number between 0 - 5, run the program on number 9 again to see how much money you would actually have to spend to win a jackpot
11. If the jackpot prize was 30000 EUR, how much profit/loss do you make?
